# Tree Species Classification

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a system capable of identifying and classifying different species of trees based on input data, such as images or descriptive features. The goal is to assist researchers, botanists, and nature enthusiasts in accurately determining tree species in various environments.

## Key Objectives

- Collect and organize data representing various tree species.
- Develop a method to analyze the input data and distinguish between species.
- Provide an easy-to-use interface for users to input data and receive classification results.
- Evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the classification system.

## Potential Applications

- Supporting ecological research and biodiversity studies.
- Assisting in forest management and conservation efforts.
- Educating the public about local flora.

## Future Directions

- Expanding the system to include more species and regions.
- Integrating additional data types (e.g., leaf shape, bark texture, geographic location).
- Improving classification accuracy through continuous learning and feedback.
